# Fun-Fact Generator (Programming Edition) üñ•Ô∏è

Welcome to the **Fun-Fact Generator**! This simple web application generates random fun facts about programming. The project is built using **HTML, CSS, jQuery**, and **AJAX** to fetch facts from a local JSON file.

## Features üöÄ

- **Random Fun Facts:** Generates random programming facts each time you click the "Generate" button.
- **AJAX Integration:** Uses AJAX to fetch data from a local JSON file containing 30 fun programming facts.

## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è

1. The fun facts are stored in a local `facts.json` file.
2. When the user clicks the "Generate" button, an AJAX request is made to fetch a random fact from the JSON file.
3. The fetched fact is then displayed in the center of the screen.
